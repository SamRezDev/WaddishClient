A MERN app that helps you find your freshest recipes  



Hello ! 

I made this app to practice my CRUD skills on a fullstack applications using MongoDB , ExpressJS, ReactJS and Node.JS ( MERN Stack)

Idea :
do you ever find yourself hungry ,but have no idea what to cook? and you also lack inspiration from exciting dishes that you haven't seen since forever?

This app solves that problem

You can basically add ANY recipe you want
,and then the app will randomly suggest to you a Recipe/Dish that you might like 
and if you get tired of one specific one always popping up, you can choose to "forget it" for a set amount of days
